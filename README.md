## How to use this project

### Create a new note

On the right-hand side of the page, you can create a new note by entering text into the "Note Title" and "Note Text" sections. Text must be entered in both sections in order for the "Save Note" button to appear in the top-right corner of the page. Clicking this button will save the note in a list located on the left-hand side of the page.

If any text is entered in a section, a "Clear Form" button appears in the top-right corner of the page. You can click this button to delete all text from the new note.

While viewing an existing note, a "New Note" button appears in the top-right corner of the page. Clicking this button opens an empty note on the right-hand side of the page to allow the user to create a new note.

### View an existing note

On the left-hand side of the page, a list of saved notes are displayed. You can choose which note to view by clicking on the title of the note. If there are no saved notes, then the list will be empty.

### Delete an existing note

Click the "Trash" icon located to the right of any saved note to delete that note.

### Return to the start page
